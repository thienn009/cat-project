            <hr>
            <p>We tend to think cats have it pretty easy (Sleeping all day? Yes, please!), but the truth is, they can and do experience stress. Environmental enrichment, particularly for indoor cats, can increase physical activity and mental stimulation, keeping behavioral issues at bay. If your cat is living in an environment of plenty-that is, plenty of room, toys, perches, windows, sleeping areas, food, water, litter boxes, and human interaction-chances are, he's pleased.</p>

            <p>What is most important for your cat's happiness? It depends. Every cat is different, but like humans, they're all creatures of habit. If your cat is regularly engaging in the activities he enjoys most-whether it's snuggling his favorite human or some of his lesser desired traits, like jumping onto the kitchen counter-he's likely got no complaints. Have you noticed your cat isn't doing what he used to? Talk to your veterinarian. She can help you uncover any underlying medical issues and develop a treatment plan to get him back to his old habits.</p>
